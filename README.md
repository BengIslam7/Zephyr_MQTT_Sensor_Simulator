# Zephyr MQTT Simulator

Zephyr MQTT client that publishes simulated sensor data to the MQTT broker and subscribes to the topic "rtest" to receive messages from the broker.
It runs on the **native_sim** board, allowing you to test Zephyr applications directly on your host PC (Linux, macOS, or Windows) without hardware.

---

## 🌐 Network Configuration

The Zephyr native_sim target runs as a Linux process and can emulate hardware peripherals such as Ethernet using the Zeth driver.
Zeth (short for Zephyr Ethernet) is a virtual Ethernet driver that connects the simulated Zephyr system (native_sim) to your host’s networking stack through a TAP interface.

### ⚙️ Configure the Host TAP Interface

Edit the configuration file located at tools/net-tools/zeth.conf:

```bash
IPV4_ADDR_1="192.168.1.100/24"   # Host TAP interface IP
IPV4_ROUTE_1="192.168.1.1/24"    # Default route or gateway to reach external network (e.g., MQTT broker)
```

Then, set up the TAP interface using the provided script:

```bash
./tools/net-tools/net-setup.sh start
```

This script creates and configures the zeth TAP device on the host.

### 🧩 Configure the Zephyr Application

In your Zephyr project's prj.conf, specify the IP settings for the Zephyr side:

```bash
CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_MY_IPV4_ADDR="192.168.1.99"   # IP of the Zephyr simulated node
CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_PEER_IPV4_ADDR="192.168.1.100" # IP of the host TAP interface
```

Additionally, make sure your application source code uses the same host IP address when configuring the broker or peer connection.
For example, in your MQTT or socket client code:

```bash
inet_pton(AF_INET, "192.168.1.100", &broker4->sin_addr);
```

This line ensures that your Zephyr application connects to the correct host (the TAP interface created by Zeth).

⚠️ Tip: Always keep the IP addresses in zeth.conf, prj.conf, and your source code consistent to avoid connection issues.

## 🧠 Install and Configure Mosquitto (MQTT Broker)

You can use Eclipse Mosquitto as a lightweight MQTT broker on your Linux host.

- Install Mosquitto and its clients:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

- Enable and start the Mosquitto service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

- Verify that the broker is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```

- (Optional) Test locally from your host:

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test/topic &
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test/topic -m "Hello from host"
```

- Your Zephyr application can now connect to this broker using:

```bash
inet_pton(AF_INET, "192.168.1.100", &broker4->sin_addr);
```

## ⚙️ Build

Clean and build the project using the `native_sim` board target:

```bash
west build -b native_sim --pristine
```

* `-b native_sim`: Specifies the target board for simulation.
* `--pristine`: Ensures a clean build by deleting the previous build directory.

---

## 🚀 Run

After building, run the generated executable:

```bash
build/zephyr/zephyr.exe
```

Or, depending on your system:

```bash
./build/zephyr/zephyr.exe
```

If you are using Linux, the output will appear in your terminal, for example:

```bash
*** Booting Zephyr OS build v4.2.0-2974-g0c84cc5bc69f ***
[00:00:00.000,000] <inf> net_config: Initializing network

```

## 🧩 MQTT Test Commands

You can monitor MQTT traffic and simulate data using Mosquitto:

**Subscribe to sensors/temperature_humidity topic:**

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t sensors/temperature_humidity
```

**Continuously publish test messages:**

```bash
while true; do
  mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.100 -t rtest -m "Hello from loop $(date +%T)"
  sleep 1
done
```

This loop publishes a message every second to the topic rtest, allowing you to see live MQTT communication between your Zephyr application and the broker.

## 🧹 Clean the Build

To remove all generated build files:

```bash
west build -t clean
```

or simply delete the build directory:

```bash
rm -rf build
```

## 📦 CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and optionally releases firmware for Zephyr boards.

### Workflow Triggers

The pipeline runs on:

* Pushes to `main` or `develop` branches.
* Pushes of tags matching `v*.*.*`.
* Pull requests targeting `main` or `develop`.
* Manual workflow dispatch.

### Jobs

1. **Build**:

   * Checks out the repository.
   * Installs host dependencies (CMake, Ninja, Python, etc.).
   * Sets up a Python virtual environment and installs `west`.
   * Initializes the Zephyr workspace and installs required packages and SDK.
   * Builds the firmware for the specified board(s) (`native_sim` by default).
   * Uploads the firmware artifacts (`zephyr.exe` and `zephyr.elf`).

2. **Release**:

   * Downloads the firmware artifact from the build job.
   * Creates a GitHub Release and attaches the firmware files.

> ⚠️ Adjust `matrix:board:[]` in `.github/workflows/zephyr-ci-cd.yml` for additional boards as needed.

---

## 📝 Notes

* The `native_sim` board is ideal for testing Zephyr applications on your host without hardware.
* To build for a real board, replace `native_sim` with your board name (e.g., `nucleo_f746zg`).
* The CI/CD workflow ensures your firmware is automatically built and optionally released on GitHub.
